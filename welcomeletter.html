    <b>Dear Delegates,</b><br />
    <br />
As this year’s Secretary General it is my honour and pleasure to welcome you to the first sessions of 60MUN,
the Modal United Nations organized by the 60.Yıl Anatolian High School and its community.
We will have the privilege to be your humble host in this first-of-its-kind conference which will be held in between 31th January and
3th February in İzmir, the outstanding coastal city of the one and only Turkey. We believe that no city would be a better host than İzmir
with both beautiful landscapes and historical background city of ours possesses. We and Izmir kindly invite you to attend our prestigious
conference.
<br />
<br />
In this year’s confernce we aim to create awareness about the serious global problems in our lovely delegates.
We hope it will help our esteemed delegates to establish an alternative point of view in the global politics.
In its first year 60MUN will be holding 5 committees which are: <br />
United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), United Nations Security Council (UNSC), United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and
a Star Wars themed committee.
<br />
<br />
On the behalf of both Academic and Organization teams, we strongly believe our main goal is
to make an unforgettable conference which will create the aspiration for the upcoming years of 60MUN organisation.
<br />
<br />
To conclude my letter, I would like to invite you to be a part of the beginning of a stately tradition.
We are looking to see you in the first sessions of this year’s 60MUN.
<br />
<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
<b>Murat N. ÇOLAK</b><br />
Secretary General, 60MUN 2017
