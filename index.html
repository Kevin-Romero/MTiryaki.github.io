    <h1>Welcome Speech</h1>
    <b>Most Esteemed 60MUN Participants,</b><br />
It is my utmost pleasure to welcome you to the 1st session of 60 Model United Nations.
As it will always be, our first-of-its-kind 60MUN conference will host young delegates,
introduce them to the world of MUN and give them a remarkable opportunity to broaden their perspectives,
improve their public speaking and negotiation skills and help them adapt to a political environment.
We aim to make this year’s 60MUN prominent and hope that all of our participants will have their expectations of the approaching
four days fulfilled.
<br />
<br />
Standing here with the length of my High School life and MUN career in between, I am overwhelmed with the joy that my appointment as
the Secretary General has brought me. Now, for the sake of the upcoming MUN generation, our aim is to make this year’s conference another
unforgettable experience. Me and my Deputy Secretaries General are certain that we will be able to accomplish this goal, provided that we work
for it by giving this organization nothing less but our all.
<br />
<br />
We look forward to seeing all of you in our conference that will be overflowing with brand-new interpretations of,
and innovative solutions to worldwide concerns, long-lasting friendships and productive debates.
It has always been one of our main objectives to make 60MUN as entertaining and memorable as it is educational and thought-provoking.
We intend for every single one of you to depart with memories that will last you a lifetime.
<br />
<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
<b>Murat N. ÇOLAK</b><br />
Secretary General, 60MUN 2017
