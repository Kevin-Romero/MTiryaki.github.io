    <!--<h1>Welcome Speech from our Secretary General</h1>-->
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Dear Delegates,</b><br />
As this year’s Secretary General it is my honour and pleasure to welcome you to the first sessions of 60MUN,
the Modal United Nations organized by the 60.Yıl Anatolian High School and its community.
We will have the privilege to be your humble host in this first-of-its-kind conference which will be held in between 31th January and
3th February in İzmir, the outstanding coastal city of the one and only Turkey. We believe that no city would be a better host than İzmir
with both beautiful landscapes and historical background city of ours possesses. We and Izmir kindly invite you to attend our prestigious
conference.
<br />
<br />
In this year’s confernce we aim to create awareness about the serious global problems in our lovely delegates.
We hope it will help our esteemed delegates to establish an alternative point of view in the global politics.
In its first year 60MUN will be holding 5 committees which are:
 United Nations Security Council (UNSC), United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
<br />
<br />
We look forward to seeing all of you in our conference that will be overflowing with brand-new interpretations of,
and innovative solutions to worldwide concerns, long-lasting friendships and productive debates.
It has always been one of our main objectives to make 60MUN as entertaining and memorable as it is educational and thought-provoking.
We intend for every single one of you to depart with memories that will last you a lifetime.
<br />
<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
<b>Murat N. ÇOLAK</b><br />
Secretary General, 60MUN 2017
