Oh.
It's you.

You actually found this.

This is sort of a hidden credits page that I want to add just because I can.

First off, shoutouts to my companions during this fucklong journey.

An enormous shoutout to Samantha "Benolot" Paewaroon for being my go-to for all the issues that have arisen during the making of this site.
Thanks, Spamantha.

A slightly less bigger shoutout to picapi_ for letting me use his javascript countdown timer. Thanks, pica.

A consumer-grade shoutout to all the straw-grasping Game Detectives who've been working their
ass/brains/other body parts/bots off with various ARGs, be it making them or solving them. Thanks, Team Look in the Bushes.

A special shoutout to the community of FastCo for making me wake up at 5 AM every goddamn sunday. Thanks, Sleight.

Secondly, some more thanks.

Thanks to the Pyrotech guys, the Geek-Nerd Thought Organization guys and my friends for putting up with my mindfucking DM stuff and thanks to ICBMoose for being my wing-DM for these campaigns.

Thanks to Arch and the rest of the Kingmaker guys for not getting mad at me fucking up all my rolls.

Thanks to whoever made Atom and Github for letting me make this site for effectively free. Go open source!

Thanks to Ken Wheeler for slick, the easy carousel.

And finally, thank you. Dunno why I'm thanking you, but nevertheless, thank you.
